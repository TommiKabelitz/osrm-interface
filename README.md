# osrm-interface

Rust interface for [OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)](http://project-osrm.org/). Includes low-level 
native bindings to osrm-backend and a wrapper for the HTTP request server. In addition, provides a 
mocking mode for simplified development. The native bindings provides an idiomatic and type-safe 
interface to access core OSRM functionalities (`nearest`, `route`, `table`, `trip`, `match`) 
from Rust.

osrm-interface provides a comprehensive interface to call into osrm-backend v6.0.0, the
open source routing machine. The crate provides the capability to call into the backend
natively if it is installed through FFI, alternatively through the web API.

Forked from [osrm-binding](https://github.com/mathias-vandaele/osrm-binding) which provided the initial FFI interface for this crate and also supports building of OSRM itself, unlike this fork.

## Engines

The osrm engine is an instance which allows calling of the various services provided by osrm.
Three engines are provided. Their API's differ only in initialisation. Otherwise they are identical.
To minimise compile times and binary sizes, the native and remote engines are disabled by default
and are gated by feature flags.

- mock: For development convenience when the backend is otherwise unavailable.
  Returns the correct response types, but with fabricated data.
- remote (`feature="remote"`): Call using the web API. Works with `osrm-routed` running locally or
  remotely.
- native (`feature="native"`): Call by natively interfacing into an installed version of osrm-backend
  through a C++ wrapper. **REQUIRES A LOCAL INSTALLATION OF `osrm-backend` AND LOCAL VERSIONS OF
  APPROPRIATELY EXTRACTED MAP DATA**.

For more information about initialising the engines and their requirements, see their module pages.

## Services

The following services are presently supported. All services use the [`Point`] struct which is
initialised from a (latitude, longitude) pair to store coordinates in a type safe mannner. 
Alternatively, exact points in the form of a `Hint` (base64 encoded `String`), returned by nearest 
(and optionally the other services) which are already snapped to the grid may be used.

- nearest: Snap the given `Point` to the closest node on the map. Returning the snapped coordinates
  and other information.
- table: Given a set of source and destination `Point`s or `Hint`s, determine the distances and/or durations
  to travel between all sources and destinations.
- route: Given an ordered set of `Point`s or `Hint`s, route through those points in the given order.
- match: Given an ordered set of `Point`s or `Hint`s (and optionally timestamps), determine the likely
  route taken that could match those coordinates. Returns the route and confidence values.
- trip: Given an _unordered_ set of `Point`s or `Hint`s, uses a greedy heuristic to approximately solve
  the travelling salesman problem. Returns the fastest route through those points in some order.

All service request are constructed using their corresponding request builders. These builders attempt to
verify whether the request will be rejected by OSRM before calling the service with transparent error messages.
The builders also showcase the many options available for each service. See the builders (in the services)
for their available options.

The tile service is not currently supported. I have no plans to add support, but a pull request is welcome
if someone would like to add it.

## Feature flags

Feature flags are used aggressively to gate substantial portions of code from the crate to help with compile times.
- `feature="native"`: Enable the native engine - will not compile without the ability to link a compiled version of
  osrm-backend.
- `feature="remote"`: Enable the remote engine for routing through the HTTP web API.
- `feature="serde"`: Add [`serde::Serialize`] and [`serde::Deserialize`] to all types. Response types require `Deserialize`
  when using the remote and native engines anyway, so the remote and native feature flags will enable this flag also.

## Example usage

First initialise the appropriate engine. Then construct your requests with
the request builders.
```
// native engine requires map path and algorithm and returns a Result
// remote engine requires profile and an endpoint address
use osrm_interface::{Point, route::RouteRequestBuilder};
let engine = osrm_interface::mock::OsrmEngine::new();
let points = [
    Point::new(48.040437, 10.316550).expect("Invalid point"),
    Point::new(49.006101, 9.052887).expect("Invalid point"),
    Point::new(48.942296, 10.510960).expect("Invalid point"),
    Point::new(51.248931, 7.594814).expect("Invalid point"),
];
let route_request = RouteRequestBuilder::new(&points)
    .build()
    .expect("No points in request");
let response = engine
    .route(&route_request)
    .expect("Failed to route request");
```

## A note on snapping

The nearest service provides snapping of `Points` to nodes on the map. All
services will also snap `Points` to the map. To avoid snapping, pass `Hints`
to the various services which allows the service to skip the snapping which
has already been done. `Hints` can be returned by all services and are returned
by default.
In addition, be aware that the nearest node that can be snapped to is in no
way limited by distance. If the backend is running on the Germany map for
example, and the user requests a point with a lat/long in the USA, then the
snapping will return the closest node in the German map (likely on the
south-western side). This is also true when points near country borders are
snapped using map data which does not contain both countries.

## Serialisation/Deserialisation

Presently, both the native and remote engines generate/request json to serialise the responses. osrm-backend supports
a more efficient flatbuffer format which is exposed through their include headers. I plan to add support for this
format in the future at which point the two forms will both be supported, with the flatbuffer format providing better
format, and the json format providing human readability.

## General OSRM documentation

The main [osrm-backend documentation](<https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki>) is located on the osrm-backend
Rust interface for [OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)](http://project-osrm.org/). Includes low-level native bindings to osrm-backend and a wrapper for the HTTP request server. In addition, provides a mocking mode for simplified development. The native bindings provides an idiomatic and type-safe interface to access core OSRM functionalities (`route`, `table`, `trip`) from Rust.
Github. The HTTP API of `osrm-routed` is a good source of information.

## Building for native features

Native requires a built version of [osrm-backend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend) with it's installed headers added to the include path. A fully installed osrm-backend will place all required headers on the include path by default. To call into osrm-backend natively, there is a `.cpp` wrapper which provides `C` bindings to the required osrm services. To build this wrapper requires a `C++` compiler which supports `std=c++17`. I have successfully built it with `g++-12` and newer versions should work also. Clang should also work but is untested.

Cargo uses your default `c++` compiler by default, to override this, simply 

```bash
export CXX=g++-12 # whichever compiler you have
```

In addition, to run natively requires appropriately extracted osrm-map data. As described on [osrm-backend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend), map data can be obtained from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/) and then needs to be extracted with `osrm-extract` before being partitioned (`osrm-partition`) and customized (`osrm-customize`) for MLD or contracted (`osrm-contract`) for CH.

The path to the map data needs to be specified in the `.env` file to run the tests which attempt to route in Germany.

For more information about building and compilation see the native module in the docs.rs documentation.
